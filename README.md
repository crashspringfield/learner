# Learner
Learner is a synth that teaches you the basics of subtractive synthesis. Currently, it's wrapper around MonoSynth from [Tone.js](http://https://tonejs.github.io "Tone.js") but will probably change to expand modulation capabilities.

This is very much a work in progress.

## Getting started
```
git clone https://github.com/crashspringfield/learner.git && cd learner
npm install
npx webpack
```
...and open index.html in your browser

## Built with help from
input knobs and sliders by [https://g200kg.github.io/input-knobs/](https://g200kg.github.io/input-knobs/)
keyboard by [https://codepen.io/attilahajzer/pen/kydqJ](https://codepen.io/attilahajzer/pen/kydqJ)

## TODO
- clean code
- incorporate JS libraries into build
- move from MonoSynth to custom synth
- LFO and modulation patching
